# Scheme_MPS
Implementing Scheme (R6RS) in Jetbrains' MPS (MetaProgramming)

Potential TODOs:

- Extend to Clojure (would be relatively nice, since it can actually is interoperable with JVM, and therefore would be beneficial to generate to MPS Java implementation aka Base Language)

- Extend to Racket (since racket is already a workbench)

- Make it useable in creating languages with MPS (ex. when adding behavior to your DSL, you could be able to use Base Language or Scheme/Clojure/Racket !!!)
